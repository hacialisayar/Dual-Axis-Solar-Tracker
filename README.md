Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker
Dual axis solar tracker with light dependent resistor and Arduino The aim of this study is to design a low cost and automatic system that follows the sun by moving in two axes and to simulate this designed system. Solar panels collect sunlight and generate electrical energy thanks to the solar cells on them. This production process depends on factors such as the amount of light coming to the panel, the ambient temperature, the angle of incidence of the sun's rays. In our study, we are focused on the angle of sunlight falling on solar panels. In order for solar panels to produce maximum energy, the sun's rays must come with 90 degrees. However, since the sun's position changes constantly throughout the day, fixed panels cannot produce maximum energy. If solar panels are provided to follow the sun, the amount of energy obtained from production can be increased. In the project, a system that enables the panel to follow the sun was created by using a light-dependent resistor, microprocessor, and motors via a simulation program. This system will be integrated into the solar panel, its energy information will be obtained, it will be compared with the energy produced by the fixed axis solar panel and the efficiency of the panel moving in the dual axis will be calculated.
